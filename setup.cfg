# This flag says to generate wheels that support both Python 2 and Python
# 3. If your code will not run unchanged on both Python 2 and 3, you will
# need to generate separate wheels for each Python version that you
# support. Removing this line (or setting universal to 0) will prevent
# bdist_wheel from trying to make a universal wheel. For more see:
